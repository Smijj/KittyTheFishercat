This is a game about a kitty who just wants to eat fish and sleep~ But how does he get the fish? By fishing of course, to the beat of some funky tunes even! This is a rhythm game after all...
I used Godot for the first time to make this game which was an interesting experience I must say :O

I made this game in collaboration with Skye Lavelle for the NT game jam '[READY, SET, GODOT!](https://itch.io/jam/ready-set-godot)' hosted by The Array []
